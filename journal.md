Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

Honestly, AI tools for “vibe coding” are a bit of a blessing and a curse for comp sci students. Yeah, they turbocharge your workflowsuddenly, you’re breezing past the boring setup stuff, and you can jump right into the juicy bits of your project Like GitHub Copilot Total time-saver for pumping out boilerplate or sketching out an API skeleton so you can focus on the bigger picture.
But here’s the rub: lean on them too much, and you’re basically skipping leg day for your brain. If you’re always letting AI patch up your gnarly syntax errors or straight-up write your core algorithms, you’ll never get the hang of tracing code execution on your own. Those weird little quirks and aha! moments of a programming language? You miss em. Its like letting your calculator do the math homework—sure, you get the answer, but did you actually learn anything?
Bottom line AI’s a solid wingman, but if you want to actually get goodlike, “IbreatheJavaScript good—you have to wrestle with code yourself. Embrace the struggle. That’s where the real magic happens. Otherwise, youre just coasting and hoping the wheels don’t fall off when the training wheels come off.

I would be interested in the marines.Ive been interested in the marines my whole life and i plan to do 2 years of college first and then go to the marines for 20 years so i can retire.
and afther that i plan to do cyber securtiy. They also make a lot of money in that industry.

My idea for the Presidential AI Challenge is an AI-powered virtual study partner that uses natural language processing to assist students with their homework and study habits.This project directly addresses the education category by providing a personalized and accessible learning tool. To ensure ethical use, the AI would be trained to offer Socratic questioning and hints rather than simply giving away answers, which prevents cheating and promotes genuine understanding. The concept is realistic and can be built using existing large language models and would be responsibly and ethically developed. The project's utility lies in providing equitable access to personalized academic support for students who may not have a tutor or a parent available to help. It helps people by fostering independent learning, improving academic outcomes, and building confidence in subjects where they might otherwise struggle. This responsible application of AI could significantly bridge educational resource gaps within communities.

I really think that working in a virtual store for real money is a fantastic idea for the future of jobs. Take IKEA, for instance—they recently launched a virtual store on the Roblox platform and are even hiring paid "co-workers" to assist customers. This innovative strategy is a game-changer because it broadens the potential employee pool beyond just geographical limits and traditional retail backgrounds. It opens the door for companies to connect with a digitally savvy workforce and create new, flexible career opportunities in a creative setting. This model shows that meaningful work can indeed thrive in the virtual realm, paving the way for a whole new world of employment possibilities. “This response used AI.”

Six, seven, man, I hear that all the time. It usually pops up when someone's totally done with a tough class or a boring presentation. It's like a low-key code for "I'm out," without the teacher knowing. 🚪💨 Sometimes it's whispered in the halls when everyone's just tired of the day. The tone is always super casual—maybe a little bit fed up. People keep repeating it because it’s a quick, shared way to say, "This is enough." It's the ultimate student sign-off, honestly."this response used ai"

Our school's technology policy is founded on maximizing instructional focus and leveraging digital tools ethically. We implement a strict "phone-free" policy during all class periods, requiring cell phones to be stored away to boost student attention and improve face-to-face social engagement. 1:1 Chromebooks are designated as the primary learning tool, and AI tools like ChatGPT are integrated into the curriculum only as disclosed research assistants, personalized tutors, or drafting aids, never as a source for final, un-cited submissions. Access to online platforms is heavily filtered, allowing only curated educational and skill-building games (such as math or coding simulations) while blocking social gaming and streaming sites. This framework fosters genuine focus, ensures academic integrity by teaching proper AI citation, and transforms technology from a distraction into a powerful, ethical learning accelerator, making school better by prioritizing deep work and responsible digital citizenship."this response used ai".

I'll create an interactive educational experience that demonstrates prompt engineering principles while teaching about the solar system!
I've created an interactive Prompt Engineering Learning Lab that teaches students how to write effective AI prompts while demonstrating the concepts through a hands-on solar system quiz!
This educational tool includes three main sections: a prompt builder where students can create detailed Canva AI prompts by selecting topics, formats, and styles; an interactive solar system quiz that shows what good educational content looks like; and a reflection guide that helps students analyze their prompt-writing experience.
Try building your own prompt using the dropdown menus, then test your space knowledge with the quiz! The reflection section will help you think critically about what makes prompts effective for creating engaging educational content.

Technology plays a life-saving role in every phase of a natural disaster, from preparation to recovery, by fundamentally changing how quickly we can predict events and communicate information. Before a hurricane or flood strikes, early warning systems, powered by weather satellites and Doppler radar, track storm intensity and path, giving people crucial advance notice that can reduce damage by up to 30 percent if issued 24 hours ahead of time . During the disaster, communication and GPS are the most vital tools; mobile alerts and applications from agencies like FEMA or the Red Cross disseminate real-time evacuation orders and shelter locations, ensuring that critical information reaches communities even if TV or radio signals fail. After the storm, technologies like drones and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) become indispensable, with drones flying over damaged areas to assess infrastructure and find survivors without putting human first responders at risk, while GIS mapping helps coordinate resource allocation and prioritize the most affected areas for recovery. If I could invent a new piece of technology, it would be a Structural Integrity Sensor Network (SIS-Net) designed to protect homes in vulnerable coastal regions. SIS-Net would be composed of small, solar-powered sensors embedded in a home's foundation and walls, constantly measuring vibrations, moisture levels, and wind stress data, which is especially important for areas prone to rapid-onset events like earthquakes or flash floods. This data would be relayed to the homeowner's mobile device via a low-power, mesh network, and if the system detects an immediate, life-threatening failure risk—such as foundation shifting beyond a safe tolerance—it would automatically sound a localized, voice-based alert inside the home, telling residents to move to a designated safe room or evacuate immediately. The value of SIS-Net is that it moves beyond weather prediction to provide a personalized, physical structure warning, which would directly save lives by giving the individual resident the earliest possible warning of an imminent structural collapse.

The sudden halt of the SNAP program is a huge crisis because millions of low-income families, especially seniors and those with disabilities, are left instantly unable to afford basic healthy groceries. Technology could immediately help by establishing a real-time, geo-located platform that maps local food banks, community pantries, and free meal sites, allowing instant resource matching. The primary challenges, however, are major access barriers like the digital divide—many affected individuals lack reliable internet or smartphones—alongside legitimate privacy concerns regarding location sharing. If I were the designer, I would create a tool called "NourishNow" that focuses primarily on a free, text-message-based system, sending the address and hours of the nearest open resource after a user simply texts their zip code.
