Honestly, AI tools for “vibe coding” are a bit of a blessing and a curse for comp sci students. Yeah, they turbocharge your workflowsuddenly, you’re breezing past the boring setup stuff, and you can jump right into the juicy bits of your project Like GitHub Copilot Total time-saver for pumping out boilerplate or sketching out an API skeleton so you can focus on the bigger picture.
But here’s the rub: lean on them too much, and you’re basically skipping leg day for your brain. If you’re always letting AI patch up your gnarly syntax errors or straight-up write your core algorithms, you’ll never get the hang of tracing code execution on your own. Those weird little quirks and aha! moments of a programming language? You miss em. Its like letting your calculator do the math homework—sure, you get the answer, but did you actually learn anything?
Bottom line AI’s a solid wingman, but if you want to actually get goodlike, “IbreatheJavaScript good—you have to wrestle with code yourself. Embrace the struggle. That’s where the real magic happens. Otherwise, youre just coasting and hoping the wheels don’t fall off when the training wheels come off.
