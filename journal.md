Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!
The use of AI tools for "vibe coding" presents a dual-edged sword for computer science students, offering a significant acceleration in the learning process while simultaneously posing a risk to the development of foundational skills. My claim is that while these tools can be powerful accelerators for learning, over-reliance on them can ultimately hinder a student's ability to develop essential problem-solving skills. For example, using a tool like GitHub Copilot to generate boilerplate functions for an API can save time, allowing a student to immediately focus on a project's higher-level architecture and overall application flow. However, if a student consistently uses AI to debug complex syntax errors or to write core algorithms from scratch, they may not learn to mentally trace code execution or understand the subtle nuances of a programming language. Therefore, while AI can be a valuable partner in coding, the true reasoning and critical thinking skills required to become an expert developer are only forged through independent practice and the difficult, but necessary, process of struggling with and solving coding problems on one's own.
