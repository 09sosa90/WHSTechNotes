Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!

Honestly, AI tools for ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù are a bit of a blessing and a curse for comp sci students. Yeah, they turbocharge your workflowsuddenly, you‚Äôre breezing past the boring setup stuff, and you can jump right into the juicy bits of your project Like GitHub Copilot Total time-saver for pumping out boilerplate or sketching out an API skeleton so you can focus on the bigger picture.
But here‚Äôs the rub: lean on them too much, and you‚Äôre basically skipping leg day for your brain. If you‚Äôre always letting AI patch up your gnarly syntax errors or straight-up write your core algorithms, you‚Äôll never get the hang of tracing code execution on your own. Those weird little quirks and aha! moments of a programming language? You miss em. Its like letting your calculator do the math homework‚Äîsure, you get the answer, but did you actually learn anything?
Bottom line AI‚Äôs a solid wingman, but if you want to actually get goodlike, ‚ÄúIbreatheJavaScript good‚Äîyou have to wrestle with code yourself. Embrace the struggle. That‚Äôs where the real magic happens. Otherwise, youre just coasting and hoping the wheels don‚Äôt fall off when the training wheels come off.

I would be interested in the marines.Ive been interested in the marines my whole life and i plan to do 2 years of college first and then go to the marines for 20 years so i can retire.
and afther that i plan to do cyber securtiy. They also make a lot of money in that industry.

My idea for the Presidential AI Challenge is an AI-powered virtual study partner that uses natural language processing to assist students with their homework and study habits.This project directly addresses the education category by providing a personalized and accessible learning tool. To ensure ethical use, the AI would be trained to offer Socratic questioning and hints rather than simply giving away answers, which prevents cheating and promotes genuine understanding. The concept is realistic and can be built using existing large language models and would be responsibly and ethically developed. The project's utility lies in providing equitable access to personalized academic support for students who may not have a tutor or a parent available to help. It helps people by fostering independent learning, improving academic outcomes, and building confidence in subjects where they might otherwise struggle. This responsible application of AI could significantly bridge educational resource gaps within communities.

I really think that working in a virtual store for real money is a fantastic idea for the future of jobs. Take IKEA, for instance‚Äîthey recently launched a virtual store on the Roblox platform and are even hiring paid "co-workers" to assist customers. This innovative strategy is a game-changer because it broadens the potential employee pool beyond just geographical limits and traditional retail backgrounds. It opens the door for companies to connect with a digitally savvy workforce and create new, flexible career opportunities in a creative setting. This model shows that meaningful work can indeed thrive in the virtual realm, paving the way for a whole new world of employment possibilities. ‚ÄúThis response used AI.‚Äù

Six, seven, man, I hear that all the time. It usually pops up when someone's totally done with a tough class or a boring presentation. It's like a low-key code for "I'm out," without the teacher knowing. üö™üí® Sometimes it's whispered in the halls when everyone's just tired of the day. The tone is always super casual‚Äîmaybe a little bit fed up. People keep repeating it because it‚Äôs a quick, shared way to say, "This is enough." It's the ultimate student sign-off, honestly."this response used ai"

Our school's technology policy is founded on maximizing instructional focus and leveraging digital tools ethically. We implement a strict "phone-free" policy during all class periods, requiring cell phones to be stored away to boost student attention and improve face-to-face social engagement. 1:1 Chromebooks are designated as the primary learning tool, and AI tools like ChatGPT are integrated into the curriculum only as disclosed research assistants, personalized tutors, or drafting aids, never as a source for final, un-cited submissions. Access to online platforms is heavily filtered, allowing only curated educational and skill-building games (such as math or coding simulations) while blocking social gaming and streaming sites. This framework fosters genuine focus, ensures academic integrity by teaching proper AI citation, and transforms technology from a distraction into a powerful, ethical learning accelerator, making school better by prioritizing deep work and responsible digital citizenship."this response used ai".

I'll create an interactive educational experience that demonstrates prompt engineering principles while teaching about the solar system!
I've created an interactive Prompt Engineering Learning Lab that teaches students how to write effective AI prompts while demonstrating the concepts through a hands-on solar system quiz!
This educational tool includes three main sections: a prompt builder where students can create detailed Canva AI prompts by selecting topics, formats, and styles; an interactive solar system quiz that shows what good educational content looks like; and a reflection guide that helps students analyze their prompt-writing experience.
Try building your own prompt using the dropdown menus, then test your space knowledge with the quiz! The reflection section will help you think critically about what makes prompts effective for creating engaging educational content.
